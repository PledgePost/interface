# PledgePost

## Description

## How we have made

### Core Components of PledgePost

PledgePost consists of a core contract (PledgePost.sol) and a peripheral PoolContract.sol that is generated for each grant and a contract that mints ERC721NFT for each donation.
For QuadraticFunding, MatchingFunds calculation and Distribution are calculated automatically
There is a Pool that is the source for distributing funds for each Round, and the allocation is automatically calculated based on the amount of donations to each article. This allows for a more equitable distribution of funds and returns value to creators.

Outside of Smartcontract, we use the following tools and SDKs

- Safe AccountAbstractionSDK(AuthKit)

  Our application is not limited to Crypto native users, but in the future we would like to onboard users who are not familiar with Crypto, such as those in academia and research
  The Safe AA SDK allows users to create EOA (External Owned Acccount) using social login such as Google and Facebook, in addition to ethereum wallets such as Metamask.

- Biconomy SDK

  Create an ERC4337 compliant SmartWallet (AA wallet) based on an existing EOA or an EOA generated by Sociallogin. We also use Biconomy's Paymaster, which allows users to interact with PledgePost contracts without having to worry about the cost of gas.
  By utilizing Safe and Biconomy's SDK, we are able to provide a fairly comfortable UX.

- web3Storage

  User-generated articles are stored on IPFS via Web3Storage.
  The content is uploaded to decentralized storage, which improves reusability on other platforms.

- Tableland studio

  User comments and discussions on each article, as well as drafts that have not been uploaded, are stored in the Database using Tableland.
  Ideally, we would have liked to use XMTP for the messaging layer, but the current version only supports 1-on-1 chat not group chat like conversation unfortunately, so we decided to use Tableland Studio, a great product. The front-end application uses Tableland SDK to fetch data and store data.

- TheGraph

  As it goes without saying, the data stored on-chain by the PledgePost contract is used on the front end via Thegraph indexer. I am ashamed to say that this is my first time using Next.js13 on the front end, and I had a hard time getting Thegraph to render server-side:(

### Future Work

Here is a list of what we didn't make in the past two weeks for the future. We will keep building something cool OSS, so PR and discussion are gladly welcome :)

- Anti Sybil attacks: Implementation of on-chain verification Gitcoin Passort, Ethereum Attestation Service, or using human verification such as WorldID etc.
- Specific frontend for grant manager: Specific frontend for grant manager, distribution, etc.
- Search/ Share features: Custom queries for article search and share features on Socialmedia such as Lens and Farcaster
- Notification: Notification of comments and new articles from content creators you follow
